To-Do List Application

Overview
This is a simple and elegant To-Do List Application that allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks in a user-friendly interface. The project is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it a great example of my frontend development skills.

Add Task: Users can easily add new tasks to the list by typing the task description and clicking the "Add" button.

Mark Task as Completed: Completed tasks can be marked by simply clicking on them, visually distinguishing them from the rest.

Delete Task: Tasks can be deleted from the list when they are no longer needed.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and works flawlessly across various devices.
